/**
 * A public interface if an application requires a pre-authorization of a media, prior to its
 * playback. Applications should implement this interface when they want to obtain a
 * pre-authorization prior to calling the {@link VideoCastControllerActivity}. The implementation
 * should prepare the stage for its own out-of-bound process but should not start that till the
 * {@link MediaAuthService#startAuthorization()} is called by the CCL library. Applications should
 * provide a timeout limit to make sure that this out-of-bound process is completed within a
 * reasonable period of time.
 * <p/>
 * Framework passes an {@link MediaAuthListener} to the implementation of this interface to provide
 * a way for the implementation to callback to the framework with its results. When the
 * authorization process ends, the implementation has to call
 * {@link com.google.android.libraries.cast.companionlibrary.cast.player.MediaAuthListener#onAuthResult(MediaAuthStatus, MediaInfo, String, int, org.json.JSONObject)} // NOLINT
 * with the relevant results; whether the authorization was granted or rejected. If, however, the
 * process encounters an unrecoverable error, it has to call the
 * {@link com.google.android.libraries.cast.companionlibrary.cast.player.MediaAuthListener#onAuthFailure(String)} // NOLINT
 * callback of the {@link MediaAuthListener} to inform the framework.
 * <p/>
 * If the library decides to to interrupt the authorization process (say, a user decides to
 * interrupt the process or if it times out), it will call
 * {@link #abortAuthorization(MediaAuthStatus)} and provides a reason. Implementation has to make
 * sure that it will not call any of the framework callbacks after it has received an abort message.
 * <p/>
 * Since authorization process can be involved and may require network access, the
 * {@link MediaAuthService#startAuthorization()} method is called on a non-UI thread. Callbacks into
 * the framework can happen on or off the UI thread.
